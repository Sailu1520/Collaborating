To determine what will happen when attempting to run the given code, let's analyze it step by step.

The code provided is:
print(Hello, World!)

1. *Syntax Analysis*: The `print()` function in Python is used to output text to the screen. However, the string to be printed must be enclosed in quotes (either single quotes or double quotes).

2. *Error Identification*: In the given code, "Hello, World!" is not enclosed in quotes. This will cause a syntax error because Python interprets "Hello" and "World" as variables or keywords rather than a string.

3. *Expected Outcome*: When you attempt to run this code, Python will raise a `SyntaxError` due to the missing quotes around the string. The exact error message might look something like this:
```
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

4. *Correct Code*: To fix this issue, you need to enclose the string in quotes. The corrected code should look like this:
```
print("Hello, World!")
```

5. *Final Answer*: The final answer is: $\boxed{SyntaxError}$
